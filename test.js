I know this week has been challenging with Body Power and Chelsea but you guys really pulled it off for me, and the client is so happy with everything we have done for them. This client has been a tough nut to crack so pulling everything out the bag and getting this live for Monday has been amazing and will hopefully mean other events for us, as the feedback has been great so far for them, the proof is in the ticket sales next week so will get marketing on to this. To give you some perspective on this if we sell all the tickets available we will earn roughly over Â£50k and will deliver the new business team around 35,000 tickets."

Your hard work, commitment and extreme patience (with not just me but the client) has been amazing. Your willingness to pick up constant changes from the client and improve the site has made my role as account manager a lot easier and has greatly contributed to the client being extremely happy with the work we have done. The time and effort you have put in has not gone unnoticed. The LTA are midway through their contract and with TTF currently pitching for another one of their larger tournaments this is a very critical time for us so the work done will contribute to us securing new business and well as retaining the existing from this particular client."

His efforts have improved our relationship with the client and made sure we continue to deliver great service. From my perspective your efforts over the past fortnight in particular, across our entire portfolio and a range of customers, go way beyond the normal call of duty, you have embodied all of our values; Teamwork - You're always calm, collected, and approachable willing to help the rest of the team, despite your own workloads. Spirit - your drive to deliver quality results are second to none. Energise - Your energy, fast, accurate work and turnaround is outstanding, staying late, making nimble decisions, all to deliver for the final value - *Customer* - Thanks Chris."
