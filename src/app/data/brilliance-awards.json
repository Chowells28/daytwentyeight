This client has been a tough nut to crack so pulling everything out the bag and getting this live for Monday has been amazing and will hopefully mean other events for us, as the feedback has been great so far for them, the proof is in the ticket sales next week so will get marketing on to this. To give you some perspective on this if we sell all the tickets available we will earn roughly over Â£50k and will deliver the new business team around 35,000 tickets."
