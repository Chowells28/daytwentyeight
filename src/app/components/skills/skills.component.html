  <p class="section-title-intro skills-intro">My skills are predominantly within front-end-development such as HTML, CSS, CSS-Preprocessors (SASS), JavaScript, jQuery & Gulp. However, since the intoduction of many new javaScript frameworks my focus has been towards developing within the cross over areas of front-end / back-end development. I've been studying MongoDB, Angular, Express & Node commanly know as the MEAN stack. I have also been exposed to some of Google's web products such Google Analytics & Google Tag Manager. Working within agile development for the past 4years.</p>
